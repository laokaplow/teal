    // by prefixing with TL, then the length of the original identifier in decimal digits
    // followed by the characters
      // letters and numbers are represented directly
      // special characters are encoded as an underscore followed by a single digit n
      //    followed by n uppercase letters representing the special character
      //   or even better: TL0 followed by the characters, special characters are encoded as an underscore, foloowed by a upper case code name enclosed in 0's
      // examples:
      //         + becomes TL1_4PLUS
      //         + becomes TL0_0PLUS0
      //         symbol->int becomes TL11symbol_4DASH_6GREATERint
      //         symbol->int becomes TL0symbol_0DASH0_0GREATER0int
      // prefix could be _tl0
